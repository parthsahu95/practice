# Given a binary string A.

# Find and return the length of the longest consecutive 1â€™s that can be achieved.

# This is my own solution which i attempted. runs loop n times (Can be improved with range starting from 0)
# simpler discussed solution runs 3n times, same O(n). Just iterate and check left and right at every 0.
